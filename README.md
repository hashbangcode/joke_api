# Drupal Joke API

A Drupal module that integrates with the free to use
[Joke API](https://sv443.net/jokeapi/v2/) in order to demonstrate the technique
of service provider alteration. This is intended as an example module.

A sub-module called joke_api_stub is available to create a stub interface
between Drupal and the Joke API. This way, we don't need to connect to the API
every time, we can just install the module and use the API as it is.

See [Drupal 9: Stubbing API Modules For Fun And Profit](https://www.hashbangcode.com/article/drupal-9-stubbing-api-modules-fun-and-profit) for more information.

For a video showing this module and the stub in action see https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iisa-3LYsvk.
